# checkers

JS code example

These are checkers written in vanilla JS, HTML, CSS.

Implemented:
- obligatory fight
- kings
- interface for fast move if you can capture multiple checkers

P.S. This was my first test task, I wrote it just after courses. 
But I think it's still an interesting code, even though I've grown a lot since then
